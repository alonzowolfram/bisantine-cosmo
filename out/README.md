# File structure
Results folders generated from a `bisant-cosmo` pipeline run and stored in the `out` folder (or the folder specified in your configuration YAML file) are structured as follows:

* `./`
    - `config`
        - `{configuration_file_name}_{datetime}.{extension}`
        - `conda_{datetime}.env`
    - `logs`
        - ...
    - `pubs`
        - `report.html` 
    - `Rdata`
        - ...
    - `tabular`
        - ...

# Details
`config`: For reproducibility and record-keeping purposes, the pipeline freezes the conda environment it is run in as well as the experimental settings for the run at the time of completion of the pipeline run (whether successful or not) and saves them as an `.env` file (conda environment) or YAML file (configuration settings).

* `{configuration_file_name}_{datetime}.{extension}`: <br /> 
A file with all the settings used for the `bisant-cosmo` run. The filename will be based on the name of the configuration YAML file that you initially used, with a tag for the date and time at the time that the current pipeline run concluded, in the format `YYYY-MO-DA-HR-MN-SC`.
<br />
<br />

* `conda_{datetime}.env`: <br />
A file containing details on the conda environment in which the pipeline was run. The filename will be `conda_{datetime}.env`, where `{datetime}` is the date and time at the time that the current pipeline run concluded, in the format `YYYY-MO-DA-HR-MN-SC`.  
<br />
<br />

`logs`: Files containing the stderr and stdout output from the scripts in the pipeline. Each rule (module) will generate its own set of stderr and stdout files.
<br />
<br />

`pubs`: Human-readable publications generated by the pipeline. These include HTML, PDF, Word, and/or PowerPoint documents.
* `report.html`: <br />
An HTML report generated from an RMarkdown template as part of a `bisant-cosmo` run. 
<br />
<br />

`Rdata`: `.rds` files generated by the pipeline. These are mostly Seurat objects at different points of the analysis, including raw data, cleaned data, and normalized data.
<br />
<br />

`tabular`: Outputs in tabular format (Excel, CSV, TSV, etc.) generated by the pipeline. These are usually the results of an analysis, such as a list of genes from a differential-expression analysis.
